Introduction to Geometry Instancing in OpenGLES.

== Description ==
The geometry instancing allows rendering multiple instances of a same object in a single rendering API call. These multiple instances differ in their generic attributes such as transformation matrices, color, scale, etc. This feature is very useful for implementing particle systems, crowd simulation, rendering of jungle trees, etc. As compared to the traditional way of rendering multiple objects in which multiple rendering APIâ€™s are called, this technique is very efficient.  This reduces the overhead of CPU intervention for making several rendering calls to the OpenGL ES rendering engine.
