== Description ==
The interface block helps in grouping the uniform variables into one logical bunch. This is very useful in grouping the related variables in the shader programing. The interface block gives an opportunity to share the uniform data among multiple programs at once.  This allows setting multiple uniform variables in one go, which can be used many times.
