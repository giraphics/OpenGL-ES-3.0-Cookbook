Introduction to Vertex Array Object(VAO).

== Description ==
This recipe demonstrates a simple grid geometry model render using of VAO in conjunction with VBO. There is no change required in shaders for programing VAO, perhaps previous recipes from this chapter can be used. VAO allows the application to quickly switch among available vertex array buffers and set respective states, this makes the rendering efficient and also helpful to keep the programming code compact and clean.
