Diffuse light application using per vertex light shading technique.


== Description ==
The recipe demonstrates the per vertex technique for diffuse shading. Diffuse light comes from a particular direction and reflects in various directions after collision with the surface of the object.  In this recipe we model this behaviour using Phong Reflection Model.

== Installation ==
