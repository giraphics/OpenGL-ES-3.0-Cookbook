Phong Shading technique application on iOS.

== Description ==
This sample application demonstrate Phong shading model.
This recipe combines the effect of our ambient (A), diffuse (D) and specular (S) illumination that we have implemented in our previous recipes using the Phong reflection model technique. Mathematically, it is the summation of ambient, diffuse and specular fragment colors.

== Installation ==
Open the project by double clicking the .xcodeproj file.
