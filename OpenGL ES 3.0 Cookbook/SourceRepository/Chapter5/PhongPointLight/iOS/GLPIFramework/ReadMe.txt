Point light using Gouraud shading.

== Description ==The Point light comes from a fixed position in the 3D space. The position of the light and vertices of the object on which it is falling is used to calculate the direction of the light. Each vertex can have different direction of light depending upon its position from the light source as shown in the below image.
