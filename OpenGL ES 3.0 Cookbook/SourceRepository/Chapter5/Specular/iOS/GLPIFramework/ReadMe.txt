Specular light per vertex light shading technique application on Android.

== Description ==
This sample application demonstrate Specular light shading with per vertex light shading technique.
Specular light is responsible for generating the shininess on the surface of an object. Unlike diffuse light which uses the incident ray and surface normal to find the intensity of light, specular light uses reflected ray and the direction from the viewer to find the intensity of light.
Note: This sample is implemented using point lighting.

== Installation ==
