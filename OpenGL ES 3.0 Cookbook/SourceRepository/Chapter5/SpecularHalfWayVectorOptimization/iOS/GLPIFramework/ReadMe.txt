Specular light per vertex shading technique with halfway optimization.

== Description ==
This recipe demonstrates Specular light shading with half way optimization. The halfway vector H is the vector between camera (viewerâ€™s) vector and incident light. It is the resultant of the vector V and L.


== Installation ==
Open the project by double clicking the .xcodeproj file.
